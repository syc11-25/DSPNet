![](./CAVE/Figure/framework.jpg)

## To train:
1. Unzip Train.zip and Test.zip.
2. Put them in the "CAVE/Data" folder
3.
```python
python Train_DSP.py
```

## To test:
```python
python Test.py
```

## Tips:
### For training:
* [CAVE Dataset](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1CXCJfzp2yfvJZ9Lg2i-mNA) (extraction code: dju8)
* The pre-trained model is provided in the "CAVE/Checkpoint/f4/Model_DSP" folder.
